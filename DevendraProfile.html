    <h2 class="headings">My Journey as Student to as a Part time Video Creator and Editor </h2>
    <p class="paragraph1">My YouTube journey started back in 2022 when I was still a student at Atal Bihari Vajpayee University.
        I was just taken a course to learn Editing and other things.
        Back then, I started creating videos to help other people with studying.
        this is when i started a YouTube Channel to create videos and in that year i was selected for an Apprentice
        in Indian Railway ( SECR Nagpur Railway) and i moved Nagpur in September 2022 and from there i grew my channel and
        gave more times to my Channel.</p>

        <p class="paragraph1">Fast forward a few years and the videos I was creating started to be geared more towards
            productivity and passing on the knowledge that got me through medical school.
            I d spend every spare minute I had planning the next video, writing scripts or researching ideas.</p>
